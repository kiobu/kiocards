# Kiocards

A Clockwork plugin that adds a keycard + clearance system to doors. Created with the SCP Foundation universe's clearances in mind (0-5).

## Usage

### Commands

**/doorsetclearance** — Sets a door's clearance level. Should be a value between 0 and 5. Restricted to super administrators.
**/doorgetclearance** — Gets a door's clearance level. Available to all players.

### Removing door clearances

To reset all door clearances on the map, simply navigate to your server's *data/kiocards/* directory and delete the file corresponding to the map's clearances you wish to delete.

### Planned features

- Show the character's clearance level below their name/physical desc.
- Force all doors with a clearance level to close after a certain amount of time.
